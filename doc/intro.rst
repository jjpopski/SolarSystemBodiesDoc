Introduction 
============

 
The Sardinia Radio Telescope is a 64-metre radio telescopes which operates from 300 MHz up to 100 GHz. 
Although pointing accuracy at its highest operating frequency is about 1 arcsec \cite{Poppi_2010}, high accuracy  ephemerides are necessary to observe planets and other solar system bodies and spacecraft. 
Positions, velocities and accelerations of major solary system bodies can be obtained with the models produced by JPL, the Development Ephemeris or just DE(number). The latest DE model is  `DE430<http://https://ipnpr.jpl.nasa.gov/progress_report/42-196/196C.pdf`>_ \cite{Folkner}.

The ephemeris file is a SPICE kernel file which has to be downloaded from jpl horizon. 
HORIZON gives a web based interface and a telnet link. 
The first one is suitable for interactive session,the latter is more appropriate for automatic operation.
